\chapter{Conclusion}
This project demonstrates the potential of integrating advanced AI into strategy games, offering both strategic challenges and narrative depth. The implementation of a grid-based war game with an LLM-driven NPC commander provides a unique gaming experience, balancing gameplay mechanics with dynamic and engaging AI behavior. With further refinements and expansions, this system can serve as a foundation for more complex and immersive strategy games in the future.
