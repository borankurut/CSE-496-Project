This project presents the development of a grid-based war game in Unity, integrating an interactive AI-driven enemy commander powered by OpenAI's large language model (LLM). The core gameplay revolves around unit deployment and combat mechanics on a grid-based battlefield. The AI commander enhances the player experience through dynamic, conversational interactions, including negotiating terms of surrender based on its internal decision-making process.

A key feature of the enemy AI is its "aggressiveness value," a variable that adjusts during gameplay to influence the rate and intensity of unit deployments, creating an adaptive challenge for the player. While the AI does not generate specific battlefield strategies or tactics, it uses its LLM capabilities to evaluate the game state and respond contextually in dialogue, enriching the narrative depth and player engagement. This project explores the integration of conversational AI in gaming, emphasizing its potential to create immersive and reactive gameplay experiences.
